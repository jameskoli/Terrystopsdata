## Introduction

This projects aims to take a deep insight into the intricate dynamics of interactions between law enforcement and the public, especially with relation to racial disparities in police stops and arrests. Examining such data is essential to comprehending the scope of racial discrimination in police forces and how it affects arrest outcomes in an era of increased scrutiny of policing tactics and systematic racial injustice. We seek to illuminate any patterns or discrepancies that could be present in these interactions by examining the relationships between officer race, perceived subject race, and stop resolutions. By means of meticulous examination and interpretation, we strive to make a meaningful contribution to the continuous discourse concerning racial parity in law enforcement and promote modifications targeted at cultivating equitable and impartial police methodologies for every community.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on law enforcement stops, including the race of the officer and perceived race of the subject, stop resolution, geographical area, and weapon involvement. It allows for analysis of potential racial disparities in stop outcomes and provides insight into the dynamics of police encounters.

## Analysis

I preprocessed the dataset to accommodate missing values, encode categorical variables, and divide it into training and testing sets before doing the classification analysis. The distribution of classes in the target variable (Stop Resolution) is then shown, and associations between the characteristics and the target are investigated, using exploratory data analysis. To find features that are pertinent to the classification process, feature engineering and selection are done. To maximize model performance, hyperparameter tweaking is carried out and a variety of classification techniques, including Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Decision Trees and Logistic Regression, are taken into consideration. The Results are then interpreted and insights into the variables affecting stop resolutions are obtained.

## Contributing

We invite all individuals passionate about addressing racial discrimination in law enforcement to contribute to our project. Your contributions can make a meaningful difference in advancing our understanding and efforts towards fostering fair and just policing practices.
